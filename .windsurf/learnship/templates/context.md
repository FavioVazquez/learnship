# Phase [N] Context: [Phase Name]

Implementation decisions captured during `discuss-phase [N]`. This file is the primary input for downstream agents — the researcher uses it to know WHAT to investigate, the planner uses it to know WHAT choices are locked.

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

[Clear statement of what this phase delivers — the scope anchor. This comes from ROADMAP.md and is fixed. Discussion clarifies implementation within this boundary.]

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### [Area 1 that was discussed]
- **D-01:** [Specific decision made]
- **D-02:** [Another decision if applicable]

### [Area 2 that was discussed]
- **D-03:** [Specific decision made]

### [Area 3 that was discussed]
- **D-04:** [Specific decision made]

### Agent's Discretion
[Areas where user explicitly said "you decide" — the agent has flexibility here during planning/implementation]

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

[Any particular references, examples, or "I want it like X" moments from discussion. Product references, specific behaviors, interaction patterns.]

[If none: "No specific requirements — open to standard approaches"]

</specifics>

<canonical_refs>
## Canonical References

**Downstream agents MUST read these before planning or implementing.**

[List every spec, ADR, feature doc, or design doc that defines requirements or constraints for this phase. Use full relative paths so agents can read them directly.]

### [Topic area 1]
- `path/to/spec-or-adr.md` — [What this doc decides/defines that's relevant]

### [Topic area 2]
- `path/to/feature-doc.md` — [What capability this defines]

[If the project has no external specs: "No external specs — requirements are fully captured in decisions above"]

</canonical_refs>

<code_context>
## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- [Component/hook/utility]: [How it could be used in this phase]

### Established Patterns
- [Pattern]: [How it constrains/enables this phase]

### Integration Points
- [Where new code connects to existing system]

</code_context>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

[Ideas that came up during discussion but belong in other phases. Captured here so they're not lost, but explicitly out of scope for this phase.]

[If none: "None — discussion stayed within phase scope"]

<good_examples>

**Example 1: Visual feature (Post Feed)**

```markdown
# Phase 3: Post Feed - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Display posts from followed users in a scrollable feed. Users can view posts and see engagement counts. Creating posts and interactions are separate phases.
</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Layout style
- Card-based layout, not timeline or list
- Each card shows: author avatar, name, timestamp, full post content, reaction counts
- Cards have subtle shadows, rounded corners — modern feel

### Loading behavior
- Infinite scroll, not pagination
- Pull-to-refresh on mobile
- New posts indicator at top ("3 new posts") rather than auto-inserting

### Empty state
- Friendly illustration + "Follow people to see posts here"
- Suggest 3-5 accounts to follow based on interests

### Agent's Discretion
- Loading skeleton design
- Exact spacing and typography
- Error state handling
</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I like how Twitter shows the new posts indicator without disrupting your scroll position"
- Cards should feel like Linear's issue cards — clean, not cluttered
</specifics>

<canonical_refs>
## Canonical References

### Feed display
- `docs/features/social-feed.md` — Feed requirements, post card fields, engagement display rules

### Empty states
- `docs/design/empty-states.md` — Empty state patterns, illustration guidelines
</canonical_refs>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Commenting on posts — Phase 5
- Bookmarking posts — add to backlog
</deferred>
```

**Example 2: CLI tool (Database backup)**

```markdown
# Phase 2: Backup Command - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

CLI command to backup database to local file or S3. Supports full and incremental backups. Restore command is a separate phase.
</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Output format
- JSON for programmatic use, table format for humans
- Default to table, --json flag for JSON
- Verbose mode (-v) shows progress, silent by default

### Flag design
- Short flags for common options: -o (output), -v (verbose), -f (force)
- Long flags for clarity: --incremental, --compress, --encrypt
- Required: database connection string (positional or --db)

### Error recovery
- Retry 3 times on network failure, then fail with clear message
- --no-retry flag to fail fast
- Partial backups are deleted on failure (no corrupt files)

### Agent's Discretion
- Exact progress bar implementation
- Compression algorithm choice
- Temp file handling
</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "I want it to feel like pg_dump — familiar to database people"
- Should work in CI pipelines (exit codes, no interactive prompts)
</specifics>

<canonical_refs>
## Canonical References

### Backup CLI
- `docs/features/backup-restore.md` — Backup requirements, supported backends, encryption spec
- `docs/decisions/adr-007-cli-conventions.md` — Flag naming, exit codes, output format standards
</canonical_refs>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Scheduled backups — separate phase
- Backup rotation/retention — add to backlog
</deferred>
```

</good_examples>

<guidelines>
**This template captures DECISIONS for downstream agents.**

The output should answer: "What does the researcher need to investigate? What choices are locked for the planner?"

**Good content (concrete decisions):**
- "Card-based layout, not timeline"
- "Retry 3 times on network failure, then fail"
- "Group by year, then by month"
- "JSON for programmatic use, table for humans"

**Bad content (too vague):**
- "Should feel modern and clean"
- "Good user experience"
- "Fast and responsive"
- "Easy to use"

**After creation:**
- File lives in phase directory: `.planning/phases/XX-name/{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md`
- The researcher uses decisions to focus investigation AND reads canonical_refs to know WHAT docs to study
- The planner uses decisions + research to create executable tasks AND reads canonical_refs to verify alignment
- Downstream agents should NOT need to ask the user again about captured decisions

**Canonical references:**
- The `<canonical_refs>` section is MANDATORY. Every CONTEXT.md must have one.
- If your project has external specs, ADRs, or design docs, list them with full relative paths grouped by topic
- If ROADMAP.md lists `Canonical refs:` per phase, extract and expand those
- If no external specs exist, say so explicitly — don't silently omit the section
</guidelines>
