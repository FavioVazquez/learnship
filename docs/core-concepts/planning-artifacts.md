# Planning Artifacts

![Planning artifacts](../assets/planning-artifacts.png)

Every learnship project creates a `.planning/` directory at the project root. These files are the structured memory that keeps the AI agent grounded across sessions, phases, and teammates.

## Key files explained

### `AGENTS.md` (project root)

The most important file. Placed at your project root, not in `.planning/`. Your AI platform reads it automatically as a system rule at the start of every conversation.

It contains: project soul and principles, current phase, tech stack, project structure, and a regression log. Updated automatically by workflows as phases advance.

### `STATE.md`

The session continuity file. Contains:
- Current phase and position
- What was last completed
- Active decisions and blockers
- Last session timestamp

Every workflow reads and updates `STATE.md`. If you're ever lost, `/ls` reads this file and tells you exactly where you are.

### `DECISIONS.md`

A structured log of every significant architectural choice made during the project. Each entry records:

```markdown
## DEC-001: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD | Phase: N | Type: architecture|library|pattern|scope
Context: Why this decision was needed
Options: Option A (pros/cons), Option B (pros/cons)
Choice: Option A
Rationale: Why this was chosen
Consequences: What this locks in or rules out
Status: active | superseded | reverted
```

The planner reads this before every plan creation and never contradicts active decisions. Superseded decisions are kept for history.

### `Phase CONTEXT.md`

Written by `/discuss-phase` before planning. Contains your preferences, constraints, and priorities for this specific phase. The planner reads it as the primary input — your choices override any generic best practices.

### `REQUIREMENTS.md`

Requirements with unique REQ-IDs written during `/new-project`. `/audit-milestone` checks that each REQ-ID has corresponding implementation before release.

## Committing planning artifacts

By default, all `.planning/` artifacts are committed to git alongside your code. This gives you:

- A full audit trail of decisions and plans
- The ability to roll back to any prior planning state
- Collaboration — teammates can read `DECISIONS.md` to understand why the code is the way it is

To keep planning artifacts local (private projects, sensitive info):

```json title=".planning/config.json"
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false
  }
}
```

Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore` and the artifacts stay local.
