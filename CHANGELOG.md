## [v1.3.0] — Simplified UX, smarter entry points, Gemini-generated image

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`/ls` workflow** — new primary entry point: shows project status + next step + offers to run it immediately; bootstraps new users to `/new-project` automatically
- **`/next` workflow** — auto-pilot: reads project state and runs the correct next workflow without user needing to remember command names
- **`assets/quick-start-flow.png`** — Gemini Imagen-generated diagram showing the 5-command entry surface with `/ls` as hub
- **`tests/validate_ux.sh`** — new test suite (24 checks) validating `/ls`, `/next`, README documentation, `help.md` Start Here block, and `SKILL.md` references

### Changed

- **README fully restructured** — new-user path first (install → `/ls` → 5 commands → phase loop → how it works), advanced reference below; all 8 images wired to their correct sections; emoji section headings; duplicate sections removed
- **`progress.md` Step 5** — now offers to run the next workflow immediately after displaying it
- **`help.md`** — new "Start Here" table with the 5 essential commands at the top
- **`resume-work.md`** — enriched description with natural language triggers ("continue", "where were we", "pick up where we left off")
- **`SKILL.md`** — `/ls` and `/next` added as primary entry points in workflow suggestions table
- **`tests/validate_workflows.sh`** — `ls.md` and `next.md` added to required workflows; minimum count bumped 30 → 32
- **`tests/validate_package.sh`** — `assets/quick-start-flow.png` added to required assets
- **`tests/run_all.sh`** — `validate_ux.sh` registered as Suite 4
- **`generate_images.py`** — `quick_start_flow` image definition added
- Badge count updated: 40 → 42 workflows

## [v1.2.2] — Complete parallel/agent accuracy sweep

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **`help.md`** — "Wave-based parallel execution" → "Wave-ordered execution"; "in parallel" removed from diagnose-issues description
- **`new-project.md`** — "Spawn 4 parallel research efforts (as subagents or sequential deep reads)" → "Run 4 research passes sequentially"
- **`agents/planner.md`** — wave frontmatter comment, Wave 1 description, and file-conflict rule all use "independent" / "dependency ordering" instead of "parallel"
- **`agents/debugger.md`** — "diagnosing multiple UAT gaps in parallel" → "diagnosing multiple UAT gaps"
- **`references/model-profiles.md`** — "Orchestrators resolve model before spawning" / "Pass model parameter to Task call" replaced with plain resolution logic
- **`references/ui-brand.md`** — "Spawning 4 researchers in parallel" → "Running 4 research passes"; section renamed from "Spawning Indicators" to "Activity Indicators"
- **`references/verification-patterns.md`** — "verification subagent" → "verification step"
- **`SKILL.md`** — wrong skill commands (`/motion`, `/tokens`, `/brand`) replaced with real 17 impeccable commands; "subagent contexts" → plain language

## [v1.2.1] — Accuracy pass: correct promises, real skill commands

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- **README `## Design System`** — replaced 13 fictional commands (`/motion`, `/tokens`, `/brand`, `/typography`, etc.) with the 17 real impeccable skill commands (`/audit`, `/critique`, `/polish`, `/normalize`, `/colorize`, `/animate`, `/bolder`, `/quieter`, `/distill`, `/clarify`, `/optimize`, `/harden`, `/delight`, `/extract`, `/adapt`, `/onboard`, `/teach-impeccable`)
- **README file tree** — `skills/` entry updated to show `impeccable/` subfolder with skill breakdown
- **All workflows (44 occurrences)** — `AGENTIC DEV ►` banner prefix replaced with `learnship ►` (missed in v1.2.0 sweep)
- **`execute-phase.md`** — removed false parallelism claims; wave model accurately described as dependency-ordered sequential execution
- **`plan-phase.md`** — "run in parallel" → "independent, execute in any order"
- **`map-codebase.md`** — "parallel agents" → "structured analysis"; banner updated
- **`diagnose-issues.md`** — "in parallel" removed from frontmatter description
- **README diagrams and tables** — all `parallel execution` / `parallel agents` language replaced with accurate Windsurf single-agent equivalents
- **`impeccable/audit` and `impeccable/critique`** — `{{available_commands}}` placeholder resolved to full list of real skill commands

## [v1.2.0] — Original Work: GSD scrubbed, impeccable skill integrated

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`frontend-design` skill** — now uses the full upstream [impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable) skill by @pbakaus: all 7 domain-specific reference files (typography, color, spatial, motion, interaction, responsive, ux-writing) with their complete content and 17 commands (`/audit`, `/critique`, `/polish`, `/colorize`, `/animate`, etc.)
- **`SKILL.md`** attribution updated to credit pbakaus/impeccable correctly

### Changed

- **All GSD/get-shit-done references removed** — learnship is now fully original work:
  - `references/model-profiles.md` — agent names renamed (e.g. `gsd-planner` → `planner`), Claude Code-specific notes removed
  - `references/planning-config.md` — `gsd-tools.cjs` binary calls replaced with plain `git` + `python3` bash commands; branch templates no longer prefixed with `gsd/`
  - `references/git-integration.md` — all `gsd-tools.cjs` commit commands replaced with plain `git add` + `git commit`
  - `references/ui-brand.md` — `GSD ►` banner prefix replaced with `learnship ►`
  - `references/verification-patterns.md` — stale `~/.claude/get-shit-done/` path reference removed
  - `templates/state.md` — `/gsd:add-todo` → `/add-todo`, `/gsd:check-todos` → `/check-todos`
  - `templates/project.md` — `/gsd:map-codebase` → `/map-codebase`
  - `.windsurf/workflows/quick.md` — frontmatter description updated
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — `gsd-tools.cjs` binary call guidance removed
  - `README.md` — impeccable credit URL corrected to `pbakaus/impeccable`

### Fixed

- **`SKILL.md`** — removed `{{model}}` Claude-specific template variable (not supported in Windsurf)

## [v1.1.0] — Install & Workflow Fixes

**Released:** 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`new-project`** — `.windsurf/` is now automatically added to `.gitignore` on every new and existing project, preventing AI platform files from being tracked in user repos
- **`new-project`** — new `commit_mode` configuration option: `auto` (default, commit after each workflow step) or `manual` (skip all git commits, user commits when ready)
- **`templates/config.json`** — new `commit_mode` field with default `auto`
- **Tests** — 3 test suites (`validate_package.sh`, `validate_workflows.sh`, `validate_skills.sh`) with 50 automated checks covering all required files, all 39 workflows, skills structure, and installer
- **CI** — GitHub Actions: 3 jobs — `test`, `lint-shell` (shellcheck), `validate-json`; `npm test` runs the full suite
- **`LICENSE`** — MIT license file
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** — Contributor Covenant

### Fixed

- **`npx` installer** — project install now correctly targets the user's working directory instead of the npx cache (`INIT_CWD` → `LEARNSHIP_INSTALL_CWD`)
- **`install.sh`** — added `realpath` guard to prevent `cp: same file` errors
- **README** — Mermaid diagram node labels now use `<br/>` instead of `\n` (GitHub requires `<br/>` for line breaks inside nodes)
- **README** — CI badge includes `?branch=main` and links to the workflow run page
- **CI** — `run_all.sh` exit code fixed: `set -e` + `((VAR++))` caused false failure when counter was 0

## [v1.0.0] — Initial Public Release

**Released:** 2026-03

### Platform

**40 workflows** across the full development lifecycle:

*Core phase loop:*
- `new-project` — full project initialization: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap
- `discuss-phase` — capture implementation decisions before planning
- `plan-phase` — research + create + verify plans for a phase
- `execute-phase` — wave-based parallel execution of all plans
- `verify-work` — manual UAT with auto-diagnosis and fix planning
- `complete-milestone` — archive milestone, tag release, prepare next version
- `new-milestone` — start next version cycle

*Milestone management:*
- `discuss-milestone` — capture goals and anti-goals before starting a milestone
- `add-phase`, `insert-phase`, `remove-phase` — roadmap surgery
- `audit-milestone` — requirement coverage, integration check, stub detection
- `plan-milestone-gaps` — create fix phases from audit findings
- `milestone-retrospective` — 5-question retrospective + spaced review

*Codebase intelligence:*
- `map-codebase` — parallel brownfield analysis (STACK, ARCHITECTURE, CONVENTIONS, CONCERNS)
- `research-phase` — standalone phase research
- `discovery-phase` — structured codebase discovery before planning
- `list-phase-assumptions` — surface intended approach before planning starts

*Execution:*
- `execute-plan` — run a single PLAN.md in isolation
- `quick` — ad-hoc task with atomic commits and state tracking

*Quality & debugging:*
- `debug` — systematic triage → diagnose → fix with persistent session state
- `validate-phase` — retroactive test coverage audit
- `add-tests` — generate unit and E2E tests post-execution
- `diagnose-issues` — batch-diagnose multiple UAT issues in parallel

*Context & knowledge:*
- `transition` — write full handoff document for collaborator or fresh session
- `knowledge-base` — aggregate decisions and lessons into KNOWLEDGE.md
- `decision-log` — ad-hoc architectural decision capture into DECISIONS.md

*Navigation:*
- `progress` — status overview and smart routing
- `pause-work` — save handoff state mid-phase
- `resume-work` — restore full context and continue

*Task management:*
- `add-todo`, `check-todos` — capture and act on ideas mid-session

*Maintenance & config:*
- `health` — project health check with optional `--repair`
- `cleanup` — archive completed milestone phase directories
- `settings` — interactive config editor
- `update` — self-update the platform
- `set-profile` — quick model profile switch
- `reapply-patches` — merge local edits back after an update

*Meta:*
- `help` — show all workflows with descriptions

### Skills

- `agentic-learning` — 11-action neuroscience-backed learning partner (integrated at every workflow checkpoint)
- `frontend-design` — impeccable UI design system with 7 reference files and 17 steering commands

### AGENTS.md System

- `templates/agents.md` — universal project template: Soul + 10 Principles + Platform Context
- `new-project` generates `AGENTS.md` at project root — Windsurf reads it every conversation
- `plan-phase`, `execute-phase`, `debug`, `complete-milestone`, `new-milestone` auto-update it

### Decision Intelligence Layer

- `.planning/DECISIONS.md` — structured cross-phase decision register with DEC-XXX IDs
- `decision-log` — ad-hoc decision capture from any conversation
- `discuss-phase` and `plan-phase` read DECISIONS.md — planner never contradicts active decisions

### Agent Personas

- `planner`, `researcher`, `executor`, `verifier`, `debugger` — 5 specialized agent roles

### Reference Files & Templates

- 8 reference files covering questioning, verification, git, config, model profiles, UI brand, learning design, design commands
- 7 document templates for `.planning/` artifacts and AGENTS.md
